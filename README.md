I used this code to create a database in PostgreSQL containing data on over 250,000 chess games, which was used in my 
machine learning model using TensorFlow to predict the outcome of chess games. Feel free to check it out on my GitHub, located here: https://github.com/irobinett3/machine_model,
or reach out with any questions!
